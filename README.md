LiveSplit.MagesOfMystralia
=====================
LiveSplit.MagesOfMystralia is a [LiveSplit](http://livesplit.org/) component for Mages Of Mystralia.

Features
--------
  * Keeps track of Game Time to get rid of loading times.

Requirements
------------

  * Mages Of Mystralia (tested with versions 26)
  * LiveSplit 1.4+
  * .NET Framework 4.5 

Install
-------
Starting with LiveSplit 1.4, you can download and install LiveSplit.MagesOfMystralia automatically from within the Splits Editor with just one click. Just type in "Mages Of Mystralia" and click Activate. This downloads LiveSplit.MagesOfMystralia to the Components folder.

If the plugin is not working with this process, download the plugin from the [releases page](https://github.com/SuiMachine/LiveSplit.MagesOfMystralia/releases) and place the LiveSplit.MagesOfMystralia.dll in your Components directory of LiveSplit.

Configure
---------
Open your Splits Editor and active the autosplitter. If this is not working, leave it deactivated and manually add it in the Layout Editor. You can configure the settings in whichever editor it has been enabled in.

After configuring everything you'll most likely want to turn on game time as primary timing, so that your splits will run off game time. You can do this by right-clicking LiveSplit and going to Compare Against -> Game Time.
